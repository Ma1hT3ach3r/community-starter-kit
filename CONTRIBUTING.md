### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: A couple of example sketched to show contributors what we are looking for in terms of design
- **qa-needed**: Some guidance towards answering questions with repsect to computer science, programming, and mathematical questions.
- **documentation-needed**: Rubircs to give feedback to those that participate.
- **bug-high-priority**: Ensuring that all contributions are visual the website attached to the bot
- **bug-low-priority**: typos
- **help-wanted**: Videos created to show writing code is easy, fun, and powerful.

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
